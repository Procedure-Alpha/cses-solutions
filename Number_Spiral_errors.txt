Video => Number Spiral CSES by Kathan Vakharia

DO it by Hand on Paper to visualize it, We have to find the Starting Number and Ending Number for each Square Boundary.
Then Adjust according to given position by adding or subtracting row/column values.

Practise Again atleast 3-4 times next week to build muscle memory.

Try to derive the formula from scratch understanding each part.

Compute m = max(x, y) (use long long).
Compute base = (m-1)*(m-1).
If m % 2 == 0:
if x <= y → num = base + x // right column
else → num = m*m - (y - 1) // bottom row
else (m odd):
if x <= y → num = m*m - (x - 1) // right column
else → num = base + y // bottom row


kyuki matrix  1  2  9   
	      4  3  8
	      5  6  7
aisa hai to uss hisab se direction of increase/decrease of numbers decide karenge.
